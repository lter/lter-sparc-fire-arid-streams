# nitrate

## view: combined nitrate

Create a view of standardized (forms, units) nitrate that reflects data from
from both the USGS and non-USGS data sources.

Convert NEON and SBC data (micromoles) to `mg NO3-N / L`.

```{sql}
#| eval: FALSE
#| label: nitrate-values

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS firearea.nitrate ;

CREATE VIEW firearea.nitrate AS 
SELECT
  usgs_site,
  "ActivityStartDate" AS date,
  'nitrate' as analyte,
  AVG (value_std) AS value_std,
  'mg/L as N' AS units_std
FROM firearea.usgs_water_chem_std
WHERE
  "USGSPCode" IN (
    '00618',
    '00631'
  )
GROUP BY
  usgs_site,
  date
UNION
SELECT
  usgs_site,
  date,
  analyte,
  CASE
    WHEN unit ~~* 'micromoles%' THEN mean * (14.0 / 1000.0)
    WHEN unit ~~* '%uM%' THEN mean * (14.0 / 1000.0) 
    ELSE mean
  END value_std,
  CASE
    WHEN unit ~~* 'micromoles%' THEN 'mg/L as N'
    WHEN unit ~~* '%uM%' THEN 'mg/L as N' 
    ELSE unit
  END units_std

  analyte ~~* '%nitrate%' OR
  analyte ~~* '%no3%'
) AND
  usgs_site !~~* '%bell%'
;

```


## view: nitrate_ranges (unused)

Generate a view of summary statistics surrounding nitrate data availability
(number of samples pre, post fire; time (days) since previous fire; etc.).

The `chem_ranges` CTE uses the template detailed in `chemistry with ranges`.

The `num_pre_fire` and `num_post_fire` reflect the number of nitrate
observations in the period between the fire of interest and the previous and
next fires, respectively; not to be confused with the number of observations at
any point prior to and after the fire of interest, respectively.

The number of nitrate observations reflects observations for which there is
also a discharge measurement.

This query is likely not to be employed as the project has decided to use
aggregated fires in the fire season (this query addressed only unaggregated
data) but I think there are some errors here so it should be evaluated before a
possible future use.

```{sql}

## view: nitrate_counts (summer)

Generate a view of summary statistics surrounding nitrate data
availability (number of samples pre, post fire).

The `num_pre_fire` and `num_post_fire` reflect the number of nitrate
observations in the period prior to and after fire or aggregated fires of
interest; not to be confused with the number of observations between a fire or
aggregated fires and interest and the next fire as is the case for
view::nitrate_ranges.

The number of nitrate observations reflects observations for which there is
also a discharge measurement.

```{sql}
#| eval: FALSE
#| label: nitrate-counts

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS firearea.nitrate_counts ;

CREATE VIEW firearea.nitrate_counts AS 
WITH nitrate_discharge AS (
  SELECT
    nitrate.usgs_site,
    nitrate.date
  FROM firearea.nitrate
  JOIN firearea.discharge ON (
    discharge."Date" = nitrate.date
    AND discharge.usgs_site = nitrate.usgs_site
  )
)
SELECT
  nitrate_discharge.usgs_site,
  ranges_agg.events,
  ranges_agg.start_date,
  ranges_agg.end_date,
  SUM(CASE WHEN nitrate_discharge.date < ranges_agg.start_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count_before_start,
  SUM(CASE WHEN nitrate_discharge.date > ranges_agg.end_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count_after_end

## m.view: nitrate largest fire

purpose:

This materialized view identifies the largest wildfire event per watershed
(`usgs_site`) that meets strict pre- and post-fire data quality criteria for
water quality analysis. It enables fast, repeatable queries for analyzing
wildfire impacts on nitrate and discharge patterns.

use case:

- Supports analysis of nitrate and streamflow responses to wildfire.
- Used to restrict focus to watersheds with both extensive monitoring coverage
  and a single, largest impactful fire.
- Reused in downstream workflows for filtering, reporting, or dashboard
  visualizations.

logic summary:

1. Join nitrate and discharge records by site and date.
2. Match those records to fire windows from `ranges_agg`.
3. Apply Data Sufficiency Filters:
  - Must have nitrate + discharge data in the 3 years before and after each
    fire.
  - Must include observations in flow quartiles 2, 3, and 4 in both windows.
4. Group results by fire event (site, year, start/end date).
5. Select only the largest valid fire per watershed, ranked by `cum_fire_area`.

fields included:

| Column Name      | Description                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `usgs_site`      | Watershed site identifier                                     |
| `year`           | Fire year (based on ignition date)                            |
| `start_date`     | Start date of fire event group                                |
| `end_date`       | End date of fire event group                                  |
| `cum_fire_area`  | Cumulative fire-affected area (kmÂ²) for the grouped event     |
| `before_count`   | Count of nitrate observations in 3-year window before fire  |
| `after_count`    | Count of nitrate observations in 3-year window after fire   |
| `bq2`, `bq3`, `bq4` | Count of pre-fire flow quartile 2, 3, and 4 observations   |
| `aq2`, `aq3`, `aq4` | Count of post-fire flow quartile 2, 3, and 4 observations  |

technical notes:

- Source tables: `firearea.nitrate`, `firearea.discharge`,
  `firearea.ranges_agg`
- Computation-intensive: uses joins, date filters, aggregation, and conditional
  `HAVING` clauses.
- Materialized to avoid recomputation and accelerate downstream query
  performance.
- Refresh as needed to reflect updates to nitrate, discharge, or fire data.

## export: summary largest fire nitrate sites

purpose:

This query retrieves comprehensive fire event information for each watershed
(`usgs_site`) based on the largest wildfire that also meets nitrate-discharge
data sufficiency criteria. It ensures that only those events selected for water
quality analysis are described in detail using the `ranges_agg` view.

context:

- The `ranges_agg` view aggregates fires by watershed and year,
  summarizing burn area, duration, spatial extent, and event IDs.
- The companion materialized view
  `firearea.largest_nitrate_valid_fire_per_site` filters these to a single,
  largest valid fire per watershed with adequate nitrate and discharge
  monitoring.
- This query joins the two views on `usgs_site`, `start_date`, and `end_date`
  to return only the selected fire events.

query logic:

1. Pull all rows from `firearea.ranges_agg`, which includes fire grouping
   metadata per site.
2. Filter the results to only the fire windows (start + end dates) identified
   in the nitrate validation materialized view.
3. Return the entire record for each matched fire.

input tables:

- `firearea.ranges_agg`: View of grouped and summarized fire events by site.
- `firearea.largest_nitrate_valid_fire_per_site`: Materialized view of sites
  with validated nitrate+discharge data coverage.

output columns:

## export: q+c pre-post-quartiles

synopsis:

This query (`nitrate_q_upper_quartiles`) extracts paired nitrate and discharge
observations from USGS and non-USGS monitoring sites, focusing on the periods
before and after fire. It applies **strict filtering** to ensure robust
statistical analysis:

- **Joins**: Combines standardized nitrate data (`firearea.nitrate`), combined
discharge data (`firearea.discharge`), and fire event metadata
(`firearea.ranges_agg`).
- **Time Windows**: Selects observations within 3 years before each fire
window's `start_date` and 3 years after each `end_date`.
- **Segment Labeling**: Labels each observation as `'before'` or `'after'` the
fire window.
- **Strict Inclusion Criteria**: For each site/fire window, requires:
  - nitrateâdischarge observations in both the 3-year pre- and post-fire
  windows
  - nitrateâdischarge observations must include flow quartiles 2, 3, and 4 in
  both windows
- **Output**: Returns all qualifying observations, along with counts and
quartile information, suitable for robust CâQ (concentrationâdischarge)
statistical analysis.
- omits `cum_per_cent_burned` column featured in nitrate c-q queries documented
above

## export: q+c pre-post-quartiles largest fire

purpose:

This query extracts nitrate and discharge observations from USGS watershed sites
surrounding wildfires. It isolates data for only the largest valid fire per
watershed, where validity is defined by the presence of adequate water quality
monitoring data before and after the fire.

key objectives:

- Assess hydrologic and water quality response (nitrate + flow) to wildfire
  disturbances.
- Limit analysis to only the most impactful fire per watershed, based on fire
  area (`cum_fire_area`).
- ensure fire events are sufficiently monitored, with:
  - At least 3 years of data before and after the fire.
  - Presence of streamflow across flow quartiles 2, 3, and 4 in both windows.

core logic steps:

1. Join nitrate and discharge records by site and date.
2. Filter for valid data windows:
   - Records must fall within 3 years before or after each fire.
   - Each fire must have discharge records in quartiles 2â4 in both windows.
3. Select valid fires per watershed from `ranges_agg`, ensuring they meet all
data coverage criteria.
4. Identify the largest fire per `usgs_site` by selecting the maximum
`cum_fire_area` among valid events.
5. Return nitrate + discharge records for the selected fire per watershed, with
an additional field (`segment`) labeling records as âbeforeâ or âafterâ the
fire event.

inputs:

- `firearea.nitrate`: View of USGS and non-USGS nitrate observations
- `firearea.discharge`: Daily streamflow and derived quartile classification
- `firearea.ranges_agg`: Pre-aggregated wildfire periods and fire area metrics
  per watershed

## export: q+c pre-quartiles largest fire

purpose:

This query retrieves nitrate and discharge records for USGS watershed sites
(`usgs_site`) surrounding wildfires. It ensures strong sampling coverage before
the fire, requiring observations in flow quartiles 2, 3, and 4, while placing no
constraint on post-fire sampling coverage.

**
It is important to note that the results of this query are NOT a superset of the
results of the query where we are also constraining the post-fire values to
having representative values from quartiles 2, 3, and 4. The reason is that
largest fire for a given site is not necessarily the same across the two
queries.

For example, the largest fire in catchment USGS-06259000 occurred on
2011-07-22 when both before and after fire windows must contain quartiles 2, 3,
and 4 but on 2021-08-19 when only the pre-fire data needed to reflect values in
quartiles 2, 3, and 4.
**

Note that we are not using these results for analyses but serves as the base
for subsequent queries to pull discharge and fire details for the sites.

context:

- This approach enables inclusion of fire events where post-fire data may be
  sparse, but pre-disturbance flow conditions are well characterized.
- It is ideal for analyses focused on establishing a robust pre-fire baseline
  for nitrate concentrations.

query logic:

1. Join `firearea.nitrate`, `firearea.discharge`, and `firearea.ranges_agg`.
2. Identify all fire windows per site (`usgs_site`) and evaluate 3-year
sampling windows:
   - Pre-fire window must contain observations in flow quartiles 2, 3, and 4.
   Post-fire window is included regardless of flow distribution.
3. From qualifying fire windows, select the largest fire event per site using
`cum_fire_area DESC`.
4. Return nitrateâdischarge samples from the 3-year pre- and post-fire windows,
with labeled segment (`'before'` or `'after'`).

input tables:

- `firearea.nitrate`: Standardized nitrate observations by site and date.
- `firearea.discharge`: Discharge flow volume and quartile per site and date.
- `firearea.ranges_agg`: Aggregated fire events per site, with timing and
  spatial metrics.
