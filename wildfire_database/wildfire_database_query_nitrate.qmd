# nitrate

## view: combined nitrate

Create a view of standardized (forms, units) nitrate that reflects data from
from both the USGS and non-USGS data sources.

Convert NEON and SBC data (micromoles) to `mg NO3-N / L`.

```{sql}

## view: nitrate summary all (unused)

Generate a view of summary statistics surrounding nitrate data availability
(number of samples pre, post fire; time (days) since previous fire; etc.).

The `chem_ranges` CTE uses the template detailed in `chemistry with ranges`.

The `num_pre_fire` and `num_post_fire` reflect the number of nitrate
observations in the period between the fire of interest and the previous and
next fires, respectively; not to be confused with the number of observations at
any point prior to and after the fire of interest, respectively.

The number of nitrate observations reflects observations for which there is
also a discharge measurement.

This query is likely not to be employed as the project has decided to use
aggregated fires in the fire season (this query addressed only unaggregated
data) but I think there are some errors here so it should be evaluated before a
possible future use.

## view: nitrate summary summer

Generate a view of summary statistics surrounding nitrate data
availability (number of samples pre, post fire).

The `num_pre_fire` and `num_post_fire` reflect the number of nitrate
observations in the period prior to and after fire or aggregated fires of
interest; not to be confused with the number of observations between a fire or
aggregated fires and interest and the next fire as is the case for
view::nitrate_ranges.

The number of nitrate observations reflects observations for which there is
also a discharge measurement.

## m.view: largest fire

purpose:

This materialized view identifies the largest wildfire event per watershed
(`usgs_site`) that meets strict pre- and post-fire data quality criteria for
water quality analysis. It enables fast, repeatable queries for analyzing
wildfire impacts on nitrate and discharge patterns.

use case:

- Supports analysis of nitrate and streamflow responses to wildfire.
- Used to restrict focus to watersheds with both extensive monitoring coverage
  and a single, largest impactful fire.
- Reused in downstream workflows for filtering, reporting, or dashboard
  visualizations.

logic summary:

1. Join nitrate and discharge records by site and date.
2. Match those records to fire windows from `ranges_agg`.
3. Apply Data Sufficiency Filters:
  - Must have nitrate + discharge data in the 3 years before and after each
    fire.
  - Must include observations in flow quartiles 2, 3, and 4 in both windows.
4. Group results by fire event (site, year, start/end date).
5. Select only the largest valid fire per watershed, ranked by `cum_fire_area`.

fields included:

| Column Name      | Description                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `usgs_site`      | Watershed site identifier                                     |
| `year`           | Fire year (based on ignition date)                            |
| `start_date`     | Start date of fire event group                                |
| `end_date`       | End date of fire event group                                  |
| `cum_fire_area`  | Cumulative fire-affected area (km²) for the grouped event     |
| `before_count`   | Count of nitrate observations in 3-year window before fire  |
| `after_count`    | Count of nitrate observations in 3-year window after fire   |
| `bq2`, `bq3`, `bq4` | Count of pre-fire flow quartile 2, 3, and 4 observations   |
| `aq2`, `aq3`, `aq4` | Count of post-fire flow quartile 2, 3, and 4 observations  |

technical notes:

- Source tables: `firearea.nitrate`, `firearea.discharge`,
  `firearea.ranges_agg`
- Computation-intensive: uses joins, date filters, aggregation, and conditional
  `HAVING` clauses.
- Materialized to avoid recomputation and accelerate downstream query
  performance.
- Refresh as needed to reflect updates to nitrate, discharge, or fire data.

## extract: fire-impacted c–q data extraction (light filter)

This SQL query extracts paired nitrate and discharge observations from USGS
monitoring sites, structured to analyze how fire affects
concentration–discharge (C–Q) relationships. Specifically, it:

- **Joins** standardized nitrate data (`firearea.nitrate`), daily discharge
(`firearea.discharge_daily`), and fire metadata (`firearea.ranges_agg`).
- **Labels each observation** as `"before"` or `"after"` the fire window
defined by `start_date` and `end_date` for each `usgs_site` and `year`.
- **Filters the results** to include only those site-year-fire windows with:
  - ≥ 10 valid nitrate-discharge records **before** the fire window, and
  - ≥ 10 valid records **after** the fire window.
- **Includes** the following key columns for regression analysis in R:
  - `usgs_site`, `year`, `start_date`, `end_date`
  - `cum_per_cent_burned` – cumulative % of catchment burned
  - `segment` – either `"before"` or `"after"` the fire window
  - `date`, `value_std`, and `"Flow"` – log-transformed response and predictor
  - `before_count` and `after_count` – for QA/QC or additional stratification

This filtering ensures the resulting dataset is suitable for log–log regression
models and statistical comparison of slope and intercept values across pre- and
post-fire conditions and varying fire severities.

## analyze: regression analysis: log–log c–q relationships

R script fits a log–log linear regression model to assess the relationship
between standardized nitrate concentration (`value_std`) and daily discharge
(`Flow`), stratified by site, year, fire window, and segment (before/after
fire). The model has the form:

`log(value_std) = slope * log(Flow) + log(intercept)`

key features:

- Uses only observations where `Flow > 0` and `value_std > 0`.
- Fits a model separately for each group: `usgs_site`, `year`, `start_date`,
`end_date`, `segment`.
- Extracts model coefficients using `broom::tidy()`, including:
  - `log(Flow)` slope
  - log-scale intercept (also transformed to natural scale)
  - standard errors and p-values
- Returns a wide-format table suitable for further statistical or visual
analysis.

## check: record inclusion criteria

To ensure statistical reliability, records are included in the regression
analysis only if both of the following are true for each unique group
(`usgs_site`, `year`, `start_date`, `end_date`):

- There are at least **10 valid nitrate–discharge observations before** the
fire window.
- There are at least **10 valid observations after** the fire window.

This filtering is enforced at the SQL query level, so no additional filtering
is required in R. The SQL query also returns `before_count` and `after_count`
for transparency and diagnostics.

output:

## plotting: c–q relationships

The `ggplot2` package is used to visualize how the slope of the log–log C–Q
relationship changes in response to fire severity:

1. **Paired Scatterplot:**
   - Compares `before` vs. `after` slopes for each site-year.
   - Points above the 1:1 line indicate slope increased post-fire.
   - A regression line shows overall trend.

2. **Boxplot or Density Plot:**
   - Compares the distribution of slopes between `before` and `after` groups.
   - Visualizes enrichment or dilution tendencies post-fire.

3. **Slope vs. Burn Severity Plot:**
   - Plots `log(Flow)` slope as a function of `cum_per_cent_burned`.
   - Uses `segment` as a color/facet for interpreting pre/post-fire differences.
   - Optionally fits a linear model or smooth to assess trend strength.

## extract: fire-impacted c–q data extraction (strict filter)

synopsis:

This query (`nitrate_summary_dd_area_filtered`) extracts paired nitrate and
discharge observations from USGS and non-USGS monitoring sites, focusing on the
periods before and after fire events. It applies **strict filtering** to ensure
robust statistical analysis:

- **Joins**: Combines standardized nitrate data (`firearea.nitrate`), combined
discharge data (`firearea.discharge`), and fire event metadata
(`firearea.ranges_agg`).
- **Time Windows**: Selects observations within 3 years before each fire
window's `start_date` and 3 years after each `end_date`.
- **Segment Labeling**: Labels each observation as `'before'` or `'after'` the
fire window.
- **Strict Inclusion Criteria**: For each site/fire window, requires:
  - At least 10 valid nitrate–discharge observations in both the 3-year pre- and
  post-fire windows.
  - All four discharge quartiles (1–4) must be represented in both windows.
- **Output**: Returns all qualifying observations, along with counts and
quartile information, suitable for robust C–Q (concentration–discharge)
statistical analysis.

| `after_count`         | Number of valid nitrate–discharge observations in the 3 years after fire    |

A modification of this query omits the lines:

  COUNT(CASE WHEN nitrate.date >= (ranges_agg.start_date - INTERVAL '3 years') AND nitrate.date < ranges_agg.start_date THEN 1 END) >= 10
  AND COUNT(CASE WHEN nitrate.date > ranges_agg.end_date AND nitrate.date <= (ranges_agg.end_date + INTERVAL '3 years') THEN 1 END) >= 10

Omitting those lines, removes the constraint:

  - At least 10 valid nitrate–discharge observations in both the 3-year pre- and
  post-fire windows.

## extract: fire-impacted c–q data extraction (quartiles + max fire)

purpose:

This query extracts nitrate and discharge observations from USGS watershed
sites surrounding wildfire events. It isolates data for only the largest
valid fire event per watershed, where validity is defined by the presence of
adequate water quality monitoring data before and after the fire.

key objectives:

- Assess hydrologic and water quality response (nitrate + flow) to wildfire
  disturbances.
- Limit analysis to only the most impactful fire per watershed, based on fire
  area (`cum_fire_area`).
- ensure fire events are sufficiently monitored, with:
  - At least 3 years of data before and after the fire.
  - Presence of streamflow across flow quartiles 2, 3, and 4 in both windows.

core logic steps:

1. Join nitrate and discharge records by site and date.
2. Filter for valid data windows:
   - Records must fall within 3 years before or after each fire.
   - Each fire must have discharge records in quartiles 2–4 in both windows.
3. Select valid fires per watershed from `ranges_agg`, ensuring they meet all
data coverage criteria.
4. Identify the largest fire per `usgs_site` by selecting the maximum
`cum_fire_area` among valid events.
5. Return nitrate + discharge records for the selected fire per watershed, with
an additional field (`segment`) labeling records as “before” or “after” the
fire event.

inputs:

- `firearea.nitrate`: View of USGS and non-USGS nitrate observations
- `firearea.discharge`: Daily streamflow and derived quartile classification
- `firearea.ranges_agg`: Pre-aggregated wildfire periods and fire area metrics
  per watershed

outputs:

## extract: discharge at nitrate sites

purpose:

This query retrieves all discharge observations for USGS watershed sites
(`usgs_site`) that have been validated for nitrate-based wildfire impact
analysis. These sites are selected based on the presence of both sufficient
nitrate-discharge monitoring and a clearly defined wildfire event.

context:

- This query relies on the `firearea.largest_nitrate_valid_fire_per_site`
  materialized view, which filters and identifies one largest valid fire per
  watershed.
- "Valid" fires are those for which nitrate and flow data span at least 3 years
  pre- and post-fire, and include representation across flow quartiles 2, 3,
  and 4 in both periods.

query logic:

1. Extract the list of `usgs_site` values from the validated nitrate-fire
   materialized view.
2. Select all discharge records from `firearea.discharge` where the site
   matches one of the validated sites.

input tables:

- `firearea.discharge`: Raw discharge records for all USGS sites, including
  date, flow volume, and quartile.
- `firearea.largest_nitrate_valid_fire_per_site`: Materialized view of
  validated fire events based on nitrate–discharge data quality.

output columns:

| Column Name  | Description                              |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `usgs_site`  | USGS watershed identifier                |
| `"Date"`     | Date of discharge observation            |
| `"Flow"`     | Flow volume (cubic feet per second)      |
| `"Flow_cd"`  | Qualifier code for flow measurement      |
| `quartile`   | Flow percentile category (1–4)           |

## extract: fires at nitrate sites

purpose:

This query retrieves comprehensive fire event information for each watershed
(`usgs_site`) based on the largest wildfire event that also meets
nitrate-discharge data sufficiency criteria. It ensures that only those events
selected for water quality analysis are described in detail using the
`ranges_agg` view.

context:

- The `ranges_agg` view aggregates fire events by watershed and year,
  summarizing burn area, duration, spatial extent, and event IDs.
- The companion materialized view
  `firearea.largest_nitrate_valid_fire_per_site` filters these to a single,
  largest valid fire per watershed with adequate nitrate and discharge
  monitoring.
- This query joins the two views on `usgs_site`, `start_date`, and `end_date`
  to return only the selected fire events.

query logic:

1. Pull all rows from `firearea.ranges_agg`, which includes fire grouping
   metadata per site.
2. Filter the results to only the fire windows (start + end dates) identified
   in the nitrate validation materialized view.
3. Return the entire record for each matched fire.

input tables:

- `firearea.ranges_agg`: View of grouped and summarized fire events by site.
- `firearea.largest_nitrate_valid_fire_per_site`: Materialized view of sites
  with validated nitrate+discharge data coverage.

## extract: fire-impacted c–q data extraction (pre-fire quartiles + max fire)

purpose:

This query retrieves nitrate and discharge records for USGS watershed sites
(`usgs_site`) surrounding wildfire events. It ensures strong sampling coverage
before the fire, requiring observations in flow quartiles 2, 3, and 4, while
placing no constraint on post-fire sampling coverage.

**It is important to note that the results of this query are NOT a superset of
the results of the query where we are also constraining the post-fire values to
having representative values from quartiles 2, 3, and 4. The reason is that
largest fire for a given site is not necessarily the same across the two
queries.

For example, the largest fire in catchment USGS-06259000 occurred on
2011-07-22 when both before and after fire windows must contain quartiles 2, 3,
and 4 but on 2021-08-19 when only the pre-fire data needed to reflect values in
quartiles 2, 3, and 4.**

Note that we are not using these results for analyses but serves as the base
for subsequent queries to pull discharge and fire details for the sites.

context:

- This approach enables inclusion of fire events where post-fire data may be
  sparse, but pre-disturbance flow conditions are well characterized.
- It is ideal for analyses focused on establishing a robust pre-fire baseline
  for nitrate concentrations.

query logic:

1. Join `firearea.nitrate`, `firearea.discharge`, and `firearea.ranges_agg`.
2. Identify all fire windows per site (`usgs_site`) and evaluate 3-year
sampling windows:
   - Pre-fire window must contain observations in flow quartiles 2, 3, and 4.
   Post-fire window is included regardless of flow distribution.
3. From qualifying fire windows, select the largest fire event per site using
`cum_fire_area DESC`.
4. Return nitrate–discharge samples from the 3-year pre- and post-fire windows,
with labeled segment (`'before'` or `'after'`).

input tables:

- `firearea.nitrate`: Standardized nitrate observations by site and date.
- `firearea.discharge`: Discharge flow volume and quartile per site and date.
- `firearea.ranges_agg`: Aggregated fire events per site, with timing and
  spatial metrics.
