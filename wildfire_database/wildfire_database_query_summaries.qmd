## overview

Queries for transforming (as needed) and extracting wildfire data.

Queries generate either a view, temporary table, or export. Views should be
reconstructed as needed based on database updates; of course, temporary tables
must be constructed prior to each new export. One additional query is partial,
which is a template for a CTE in subsequent queries.


## view: usgs_water_chem_std (std chem)

Generate a view of a standardized form of the USGS water-chemistry data that
will provide a starting point for generating summaries of particular analytes.

## view: ranges (individual fires)

A view of the interval (`daterange`) between sites * fires. This view allows us
to identify the timing of a separate event (water chemistry sample, discharge
value, etc.) relative to a fire within the catchment. Intervals reflect the
temporal period between a fire and the most recent fire (pre) and the next
occurring fire (post) within that catchment.

A note about quality: the construction of this table, and if and how it affects
subsequent queries in terms of inclusivity has not been evaluated thoroughly.
That is, for example, how a water-chemistry sample is categorized (pre, post)
if it were to fall on the day of the fire has not been tested.

## m.view ranges (ranges_agg (aggregated fires))

Whereas the [## individual fires] ranges calculates range statistics based on
all site and all fires, [## summer fires] addresses some pre-processing and
calculates range statistics separately on summer and non-summer fires.
Pre-processing includes filtering fires smaller than a certain percent of the
catchment burned (0.00). Summer fires are defined as fires occurring DOY 110
through 250. For summer fires, the interval between the previous fire and
latest fire are from the earliest fire in the summer period and latest fire in
the summer period.

A view of the interval (`daterange`) between sites * fires. This view allows us
to identify the timing of a separate event (water chemistry sample, discharge
value, etc.) relative to a fire within the catchment. Intervals reflect the
temporal period between a fire and the most recent fire (pre) and the next
occurring fire (post) within that catchment.

A note about quality: the construction of this table, and if and how it affects

## partial: chemistry with ranges

Designate water-chemistry measurements relative to fires (pre, post). This is a
template, the example here being for standardized nitrate data, that forms the
chem_ranges CTE of the data summary for a given analyte. This template must be
modified to reflect the analyte of interest then can be called independently
or, more usefully, as part of generating summary statistics.

## catchment spatial overlap

Calculates pairwise spatial overlap percentages and areas between all study
catchments, including both USGS and non-USGS research network sites. This
analysis identifies nested and overlapping watersheds within the study domain.

### input data sources
- **`firearea.catchments`** - USGS catchment geometries
- **`firearea.non_usgs_catchments`** - Non-USGS research network catchment geometries (NEON, SBC-LTER)
- **`firearea.ecoregion_catchments`** - Study site definitions (filters USGS catchments to study domain)

### processing logic

#### 1. catchment integration
- **UNION operation** combines USGS and non-USGS catchment geometries
- **Filtering**: USGS catchments restricted to study sites in `ecoregion_catchments`
- **Result**: Unified catchment dataset across all monitoring networks

#### 2. spatial intersection analysis
- **Pairwise comparison**: Each catchment compared against every other catchment
- **Self-exclusion**: Uses `c1.usgs_site < c2.usgs_site` to avoid self-comparison and duplicate pairs
- **Intersection detection**: `ST_Intersects()` identifies overlapping catchment pairs
- **Area calculations**: Uses spheroidal geometry (`ST_Area(geometry, TRUE)`) for accuracy

#### 3. overlap metrics calculation
- **Bidirectional percentages**: Calculates what percent of each catchment overlaps with the other
- **Actual overlap area**: Intersection area in square kilometers
- **Zero exclusion**: Filters out pairs with no actual spatial overlap

### output fields

| Field | Description | Units/Format |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `site_1` | Primary catchment identifier | USGS site ID |
| `site_2` | Comparison catchment identifier | USGS site ID |
| `percent_overlap_site1` | Percent of site_1 area overlapped by site_2 | Percentage (2 decimal places) |
| `percent_overlap_site2` | Percent of site_2 area overlapped by site_1 | Percentage (2 decimal places) |
| `overlap_area_km2` | Actual overlapping area | Square kilometers (2 decimal places) |

### data quality controls
- **Non-zero overlap requirement**: `ST_Area(ST_Intersection()) > 0` excludes trivial/edge-touching cases
- **Spheroidal calculations**: Accurate area measurements using Earth's curvature
- **NULLIF protection**: Prevents division by zero errors in percentage calculations
- **Precision control**: Results rounded to 2 decimal places for consistency

### output characteristics
- **File**: `/tmp/catchment_overlaps.csv`
- **Format**: CSV with header row
- **Record scope**: Only catchment pairs with meaningful spatial overlap
- **Ordering**: Alphabetical by primary site, then comparison site

### common overlap patterns
- **Nested catchments**: `percent_overlap_site2 = 100.00` indicates site_2 completely within site_1
- **Partial overlaps**: Both percentages < 100% indicate intersecting but not nested watersheds
- **Small overlap areas**: May indicate catchments sharing drainage boundaries or measurement uncertainties

This analysis supports understanding of spatial relationships between monitoring
sites and helps inform appropriate statistical approaches for multi-site
comparisons
