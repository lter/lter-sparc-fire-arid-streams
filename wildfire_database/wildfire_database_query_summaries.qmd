## overview

Queries to generate standardized base layers of aggregated discharge and fire
statistics, and exports of ecoregions and the overlap among catchments.

Queries generate either a table, view, materialized view, or export. Views
should be reconstructed as needed based on database updates.

Syntax to run the queries with render is included but it is expected that these
queries will be run infrequently and selectively.


## table: discharge (aggregated discharge)

A view of discharge that reflects the combined records of data from USGS and
otherwise sites.

```{sql}
#| eval: FALSE
#| connection: "pg"

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS firearea.discharge ;

CREATE TABLE firearea.discharge AS
SELECT
  discharge_daily.usgs_site,
  discharge_daily."Date",
  discharge_daily."Flow",
  discharge_daily."Flow_cd"
FROM firearea.discharge_daily
WHERE
  discharge_daily."Flow" >= 0
  AND discharge_daily.usgs_site IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT(usgs_site)
    FROM firearea.ecoregion_catchments
  )
UNION
SELECT
  non_usgs_discharge.usgs_site,
  non_usgs_discharge.date AS "Date",
  non_usgs_discharge.mean AS "Flow",
  NULL AS "Flow_cd"
FROM firearea.non_usgs_discharge
WHERE
  non_usgs_discharge.mean >= 0
;

-- Step 1: add quartile column
ALTER TABLE firearea.discharge
  ADD COLUMN quartile INTEGER ;

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE firearea.update_discharge_quartiles()
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN

WITH percentiles AS (
    SELECT

        percentile_disc(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY "Flow") AS p75
    FROM
        firearea.discharge
    GROUP BY
        usgs_site
),
-- Step 3: Assign quartiles
quartiles AS (
    SELECT
        d.usgs_site,
        d."Flow",
        CASE
            WHEN d."Flow" <= p.p25 THEN 1
            WHEN d."Flow" <= p.p50 THEN 2
            WHEN d."Flow" <= p.p75 THEN 3
            ELSE 4
        END AS quartile
    FROM
        firearea.discharge d
    JOIN
        percentiles p ON d.usgs_site = p.usgs_site
)
-- Step 4: Update the table
UPDATE firearea.discharge
SET quartile = q.quartile
FROM quartiles q
WHERE
    firearea.discharge.usgs_site = q.usgs_site
    AND firearea.discharge."Flow" = q."Flow"
  ;
-- If everything runs successfully, commit automatically
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    -- Rollback the transaction in case of failure
    RAISE NOTICE 'Transaction failed. Rolling back changes.';
    ROLLBACK;
END $$;


CALL firearea.update_discharge_quartiles();

```


## view: ranges (individual fires)

A view of the interval (`daterange`) between sites * fires. This view allows us
to identify the timing of a separate event (water chemistry sample, discharge
value, etc.) relative to a fire within the catchment. Intervals reflect the
temporal period between a fire and the most recent fire (pre) and the next
occurring fire (post) within that catchment.

A note about quality: the construction of this table, and if and how it affects
subsequent queries in terms of inclusivity has not been evaluated thoroughly.
That is, for example, how a water-chemistry sample is categorized (pre, post)
if it were to fall on the day of the fire has not been tested.

## m.view: ranges_agg (aggregated fires)

Whereas the [## individual fires] ranges calculates range statistics based on
all site and all fires, [## summer fires] addresses some pre-processing and
calculates range statistics separately on summer and non-summer fires.
Pre-processing includes filtering fires smaller than a certain percent of the
catchment burned (0.00). Summer fires are defined as fires occurring DOY 110
through 250. For summer fires, the interval between the previous fire and
latest fire are from the earliest fire in the summer period and latest fire in
the summer period.

A view of the interval (`daterange`) between sites * fires. This view allows us
to identify the timing of a separate event (water chemistry sample, discharge
value, etc.) relative to a fire within the catchment. Intervals reflect the
temporal period between a fire and the most recent fire (pre) and the next
occurring fire (post) within that catchment.

A note about quality: the construction of this table, and if and how it affects

## view: catchment_ecoregion

Ecoregion attributes for each catchment in firearea.ecoregion_catchments.

Join (spatially) usgs_site to firearea.ecoregions table. Note that these
geometries are as 4326. Changing to a projected CRS (e.g., 5070) does generate
different (and probably more accurate) results but the differences are trivial.

Note that we exclude the ecoregion with ogc_fid = 68, which is a duplicate of
the Arizona/New Mexico Mountains ecoregion ogc_fid = 52. It is unclear how a
duplicate was introduced into the ecoregions table so we will simply exclude it
here until any issues with the ecoregions table are resolved.

This view is not to be confused with the firearea.ecoregion_catchments table,
which is a table of catchments that overlap with the ecoregions. This
firearea.catchment_ecoregion view provides the ecoregion attributes for those
catchments.

Note that the following sites are excluded from the output as they are outside
the ecoregions dataset:

- hanan_bell_3
- hanan_bell_4
- redb
- sbc_lter_ata
- sbc_lter_bel

## view: catchment_dominant_ecoregion

Identifies, for each catchment (`usgs_site`), the single ecoregion record from
`firearea.catchment_ecoregion` with the largest spatial overlap. This provides
an attribution of a "dominant" Level III ecoregion to each catchment when more
than one ecoregion intersects the catchment boundary.

### logic & tie handling

1. Source: Uses the previously defined `firearea.catchment_ecoregion` view
   (which already excludes the duplicate Arizona/New Mexico Mountains polygon
   `ogc_fid = 68`).
2. Ranking: Window function ranks rows per `usgs_site` by
   - `percent_overlap` (descending)
   - `overlap_area_km2` (descending) for rare ties on percent caused by
     rounding
   - `ogc_fid` (ascending) as a final deterministic tiebreaker
3. Selection: Keeps the top-ranked (`ROW_NUMBER() = 1`) ecoregion per site.

### scientific note

Because the dominant assignment is based strictly on areal proportion, sites at
ecotones may have a relatively modest maximum percent (e.g., <60%). Researchers
should consult full overlap distributions if ecological heterogeneity is
relevant to modeling decisions. The exclusion of the duplicate polygon prevents
artificial inflation of `percent_overlap` sums but overlapping original source
polygons in the dataset (if any) could still theoretically produce sums >100%.

## export: catchment spatial overlap

Calculates pairwise spatial overlap percentages and areas between all study
catchments, including both USGS and non-USGS research network sites. This
analysis identifies nested and overlapping watersheds within the study domain.

**input data sources**
- `firearea.catchments` - USGS catchment geometries
- `firearea.non_usgs_catchments` - Non-USGS research network catchment
geometries (NEON, SBC-LTER)
- `firearea.ecoregion_catchments` - Study site definitions (filters USGS
catchments to study domain)

**processing logic**

1. catchment integration
- UNION operation combines USGS and non-USGS catchment geometries
- Filtering: USGS catchments restricted to study sites in `ecoregion_catchments`
- Result: Unified catchment dataset across all monitoring networks

2. spatial intersection analysis
- Pairwise comparison: Each catchment compared against every other catchment
- Self-exclusion: Uses `c1.usgs_site < c2.usgs_site` to avoid self-comparison
and duplicate pairs
- Intersection detection: `ST_Intersects()` identifies overlapping catchment
pairs
- Area calculations: Uses spheroidal geometry (`ST_Area(geometry, TRUE)`) for
accuracy

3. overlap metrics calculation
- Bidirectional percentages: Calculates what percent of each catchment overlaps
with the other
- Actual overlap area: Intersection area in square kilometers
- Zero exclusion: Filters out pairs with no actual spatial overlap

**output fields**

| Field | Description | Units/Format |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `site_1` | Primary catchment identifier | USGS site ID |
| `site_2` | Comparison catchment identifier | USGS site ID |
| `percent_overlap_site1` | Percent of site_1 area overlapped by site_2 | Percentage (2 decimal places) |
| `percent_overlap_site2` | Percent of site_2 area overlapped by site_1 | Percentage (2 decimal places) |
| `overlap_area_km2` | Actual overlapping area | Square kilometers (2 decimal places) |

**data quality controls**
- Non-zero overlap requirement: `ST_Area(ST_Intersection()) > 0` excludes
trivial/edge-touching cases
- Spheroidal calculations: Accurate area measurements using Earth's curvature
- NULLIF protection: Prevents division by zero errors in percentage calculations
- Precision control: Results rounded to 2 decimal places for consistency

**output characteristics**
- File: `/tmp/catchment_overlaps.csv`
- Format: CSV with header row
- Record scope: Only catchment pairs with meaningful spatial overlap
- Ordering: Alphabetical by primary site, then comparison site

**common overlap patterns**
- Nested catchments: `percent_overlap_site2 = 100.00` indicates site_2
completely within site_1
- Partial overlaps: Both percentages < 100% indicate intersecting but not nested
watersheds
- Small overlap areas: May indicate catchments sharing drainage boundaries or
measurement uncertainties

This analysis supports understanding of spatial relationships between monitoring
sites and helps inform appropriate statistical approaches for multi-site
comparisons
