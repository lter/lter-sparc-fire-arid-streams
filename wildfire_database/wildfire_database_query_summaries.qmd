# overview

Queries for transforming (as needed) and extracting wildfire data.

Queries generate either a view, temporary table, or export. Views should be
reconstructed as needed based on database updates; of course, temporary tables
must be constructed prior to each new export. One additional query is partial,
which is a template for a CTE in subsequent queries.


# view: USGS water chemistry

Generate a view of a standardized form of the USGS water-chemistry data that
will provide a starting point for generating summaries of particular analytes.

# view: ranges (intervals between fires)

## individual fires

A view of the interval (`daterange`) between sites * fires. This view allows us
to identify the timing of a separate event (water chemistry sample, discharge
value, etc.) relative to a fire within the catchment. Intervals reflect the
temporal period between a fire and the most recent fire (pre) and the next
occurring fire (post) within that catchment.

A note about quality: the construction of this table, and if and how it affects
subsequent queries in terms of inclusivity has not been evaluated thoroughly.
That is, for example, how a water-chemistry sample is categorized (pre, post)
if it were to fall on the day of the fire has not been tested.

## summer fires

Whereas the [## individual fires] ranges calculates range statistics based on
all site and all fires, [## summer fires] addresses some pre-processing and
calculates range statistics separately on summer and non-summer fires.
Pre-processing includes filtering fires smaller than a certain percent of the
catchment burned (0.00). Summer fires are defined as fires occurring DOY 110
through 250. For summer fires, the interval between the previous fire and
latest fire are from the earliest fire in the summer period and latest fire in
the summer period.

A view of the interval (`daterange`) between sites * fires. This view allows us
to identify the timing of a separate event (water chemistry sample, discharge
value, etc.) relative to a fire within the catchment. Intervals reflect the
temporal period between a fire and the most recent fire (pre) and the next
occurring fire (post) within that catchment.

or, more usefully, as part of generating summary statistics.

/ L`.
